/*INHERITANCE:INHERITANCE IS A CONCEPT IN PROGRAMMING, PARTICULARLY IN OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, 
WHERE A NEW CLASS (CALLED A SUBCLASS) CAN TAKE PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIORS (METHODS) FROM AN EXISTING 
CLASS (CALLED A SUPERCLASS). THIS ALLOWS FOR CODE REUSE.

     TYPES OF INHERITANCE:

     SINGLE LEVEL INHERITANCE: THIS OCCURS WHEN A CLASS (CHILD) INHERITS 
     FROM ONE SUPERCLASS (PARENT). THEREâ€™S A DIRECT PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP.

     HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE: IN THIS TYPE, MULTIPLE SUBCLASSES (CHILDREN) 
     INHERIT FROM A SINGLE SUPERCLASS (PARENT). IT FORMS A TREE-LIKE STRUCTURE.

     MULTI-LEVEL INHERITANCE: THIS INVOLVES A CHAIN OF INHERITANCE WHERE A 
     CLASS INHERITS FROM ANOTHER CLASS, WHICH IN TURN INHERITS FROM 
     ANOTHER CLASS, FORMING MULTIPLE LEVELS IN THE HIERARCHY.
