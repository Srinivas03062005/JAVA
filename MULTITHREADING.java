/*

use case of threads : 
when you call two functions one after the other,
the second function will only start after the first
one has finished. This is called sequential execution.

With threads, you can run both functions concurrently.
By creating two threads and assigning one function to
each thread, both threads can execute their respective
functions at (roughly) the same time, allowing them to
work in parallel. This is known as concurrent execution. 


 1. Task
Definition: A task is a specific work 
that needs to be completed.

Real-time Example: Imagine youâ€™re a chef in a 
restaurant. Your task might be to prepare a 
specific dish, like a pasta dish. In Java, a
task could be represented by a method or a 
function that performs a specific job, like 
processing user input.



2. Process
Definition: A process is an instance of a 
program that is being executed. It contains 
its own memory space and resources.

Real-time Example: Think of a restaurant as 
a process. When you open the restaurant, it 
starts running and can handle various tasks, 
like cooking, taking orders, and serving food.
In Java, when you run a program, it creates a
process. For example, if you run a Java 
application that manages a library system,
the entire library system is a process that
manages all tasks related to book management.



3. Thread
Real-time Example: Within the restaurant (the process),
there are multiple chefs (threads) working simultaneously.
One chef might be cooking pasta, another might be 
preparing salads, and another might be plating desserts.
Each chef can perform their tasks independently but 
all contribute to the overall operation of the restaurant.
In Java, you can create multiple threads to perform 
different tasks concurrently, like reading from a file
while processing user input, allowing the application
to be more efficient and responsive.

O/P EXPLANATION :

the main thread (which is executing main()) continues

   Why do we need this second approach?

   Java allows a class to extend only one other class due to 
   its single inheritance model. If you extend Thread, you 
   cannot extend any other class.
